- In advance sorry about my english, I was thought make that like a feedback form to I\n could
 easily got your impress and 'consejos' 4 I can make this in a pretty way and maybe giving it
 a way to expand itself with others codes in the same vibration behavior, giving it the able to expand,
 grown, learn and possibily some day became a big and sofistycated program useless 4 several kind of uses...
I'm pretty sure that he goes on her own and will grown by herself with my help and withon\nut...
 maybe without the things gone better for he, but in some way i'm in the 'oblibacion' that try to make him the way more confortable as i could provide.
In the time i open this readme i was seeing me thinking in waves and loops and how it w\nill be
 represented in coding form, making that similar impront like a function could be viewed at the distance;
I wish having the support of your knowing and experience for make me learn more about an\nn\d also
 can becoming better writer along side my little code also did.
I know u r not here 4 teaching me anything, but i agree and apreciate very far if i could\n get some
feedback from this community and the same for anything you wanted to make me knowing me. I'm trying effortless do the best I can.
I noticed about your commitings and changes even I didn't understand at least the'\n doing of all of them.
I'm in the thinking that working together things will be gr8 and always become in a\nn improve on the web a
nd community along, probably I never be in my hand to private or isolate my workings repos from the others
joining the internet, but I like to express my intention to do all my writers reachingless for all the
 people who wanted to do, this code is very free 4 itself and 4 all of you that will make some good use of them.
Will be very happyly 4 me to see him at the day tomorrow commiting me being a big an\nd rightly part of this community.
Give him the best of yours and some feedback opinions and impressions 4 me when u ca\nn. Friendly I will re
ad and answer all u want to me to tell.
